/My name is Komal Regmi. I am a Senior studying Nutrition Science with a minor in Information Management and Technology. Additionally, I am pursuing an M.S. in Information Management through the Fast Track program at the iSchool. My interest lies in analyzing how technology solves and migrates risks that govern our lives. I have worked and interned in various settings which has allowed me to enhance my communication, interpersonal, active listening, problem-solving and customer service skills. Apart from academics, I love to travel to new places, cook different cuisine, and spend time with my loved ones. I hope someday to travel the world.
